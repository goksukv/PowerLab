# Output Capacitance Analysis

​	This folder contains an example circuit for determining output capacitance of  semiconductor devices.

​	Under MATLAB Scripts one can see;

- 'Circuit2' A text document that imported from LT Spice for MATLAB calculations. 
- Output_capacitance_analyzer, The main scripts that calculates output capacitance of a semiconductor with respect to its V_ds voltage
- Resonance Extractor, Extracts only required part of the graph.
- sample validate, it is a on of function to see sampling errors.
- spicetxtimport, a METLAB generated script to import LT Spice text data. 

TODO

- [ ] The test is only for 120 V increase it up to 500V. Note that until know theoretical and experimental results are fit each other.
- [ ] Comments to explain code
- [ ] Plot improvements
