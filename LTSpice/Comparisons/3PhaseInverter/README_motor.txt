Simulation of 3-phase motor drive using OVP-GaN

This LTSpice project simulates a 3-phase motor drive
using OVP-GaN  GPI65015DSOVP.

A program sixstep.exe is used to produce the space vector modulation
PWM waveforms to enable the control of the 6 GaN switches.  
The sixstep.exe program uses input_3phase.txt as input control file
and the control parameters are commented within the input file.
